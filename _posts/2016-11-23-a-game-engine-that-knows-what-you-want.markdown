title: A game engine that knows what you want (?)

With the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), tasks at hand can be solved with great ease today. Newer and newer techniques related to Machine Learning (ML) and data sciences, as well as in the processing of such large data and subsequent complex networks formed by sharing the data, has provided a great leap in science and technology. 

For example, using Neural Network (NN) techniques for the sequencing of data encrypted in the human genome has become a great research interest nowadays.

Another example that can be cited are the more accurate Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms implemented in contemporary search engines and translators.

The task at hand for me is to design a game engine that can compile games/simulations/animations based on a few finite Natural Language inputs from the user. Essentially, the UI/UX shell in the engine architecture comprises of a Natural Language processor coupled with a semantic parser. The core of the engine would comprise of blocks of Recombinable Game Mechanics (RGM), and the game dynamics would obviously be based on Event and Situation Calculus.

The motive is that any novice (i.e. someone who is not a game designer ) can get his game published which can comprise of whatever he thinks of. For example, if he inputs the following queries "Hummer", "desert", "coins", "bots", and "time-lap", a racing game consisting of the player as the main character operating the Hummer through a desert terrain wherein the Hummer has to complete a lap in a finite time, simultaneously collecting coins and racing against other bots, will be published.

Opinions regarding the feasibility and lucrativeness of the task is always welcome. Any form of help will be preferred however. Mail to sagnik250@gmail.com .
